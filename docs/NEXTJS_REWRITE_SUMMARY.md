# Next.js Rewrite - Quick Reference

## 📋 Overview

**Epic:** Complete frontend rewrite with Next.js 16 + shadcn/ui
**Duration:** 12 weeks (3 months)
**Total Stories:** 25 stories across 7 phases

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1. ✅ **100% Feature Parity** - All BLE functionality (direct + proxy) maintained
2. ✅ **Dual Deployment** - Standalone (Docker) + Appwrite Cloud (separate branches)
3. ✅ **Modern Stack** - Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui
4. ✅ **Replace NGINX** - Next.js handles all routing and serving
5. ✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript strict mode coverage

## 🏗️ Architecture Comparison

### Current (Vanilla JS + NGINX)
```
Browser → NGINX (reverse proxy) → FastAPI Backend
  ↓
Vanilla JS (script.js, 1264 lines)
```

### New (Next.js Standalone)
```
Browser → Next.js Server (port 3000) → FastAPI Backend
  ↓
React Components + TypeScript + shadcn/ui
```

### New (Appwrite Cloud)
```
Browser → Appwrite Static Hosting → FastAPI Backend (VPS)
  ↓            ↓
  └─ Appwrite Auth (cookies)
```

## 📦 Deployment Modes (Feature Flag Based)

| Aspect | Standalone | Appwrite Cloud |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Branch** | `main` (single branch) | `main` (single branch) |
| **Feature Flag** | `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=standalone` | `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=appwrite` |
| **Output** | Standalone server | Static export |
| **Auth** | None (`ENABLE_AUTH=false`) | Appwrite native (`ENABLE_AUTH=true`) |
| **Hosting** | Docker (self-hosted) | Appwrite Cloud |
| **API** | Proxied via Next.js | Direct to external backend |
| **Deployment** | `docker-compose up` | GitHub Actions → Appwrite CLI |
| **Build** | `npm run build` | `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=appwrite npm run build` |

## 🚀 Quick Start (After Implementation)

### Current UI (as implemented)

- Dashboard (`/`): modern Cards with Connection status, BLE control, and an Activity panel using shadcn Tabs (Log / DDM / Events).
- Modules (`/modules`): module library table with write confirmation dialog.

### Standalone Mode (Docker)
```bash
# Clone repo (single main branch)
git clone https://github.com/josiah-nelson/SFPLiberate

# Start full stack with feature flags
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=standalone docker-compose up --build

# Access app
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Appwrite Mode (Cloud)
```bash
# Clone repo (same main branch)
git clone https://github.com/josiah-nelson/SFPLiberate

# Install dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Build static export with feature flag
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=appwrite \
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTH=true \
npm run build

# Deploy to Appwrite
appwrite deploy
```

### Hybrid Mode (Bonus: Standalone BLE Proxy + Appwrite UI)
```bash
# Run standalone BLE proxy on local machine
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 \
  --name sfp-ble-proxy \
  ghcr.io/josiah-nelson/sfpliberate-ble-proxy:latest

# Open Appwrite UI on iOS/Safari
# Go to Settings → BLE Proxy Configuration
# Enter: ws://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8081/ble/ws

# Now use public Appwrite UI with local SFP Wizard!
```

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### High Risks
1. **Web Bluetooth API compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Maintain BLE proxy; test early
2. **Appwrite static export limitations**
   - Mitigation: Test static mode in Phase 6
3. **CORS with external backend**
   - Mitigation: Configure CORS properly (STORY-023)

### Medium Risks
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Freeze scope after Phase 4
2. **Timeline delays**
   - Mitigation: Track velocity, adjust estimates

## 🎬 Next Actions

1. ✅ Review epic plan with team
2. ⏳ Create GitHub issues (see [GitHub Issues Guide](GITHUB_ISSUES_GUIDE.md)):
   - Create parent epic issue from `.github/issues/EPIC-001-nextjs-rewrite.md`
   - Create all 25 story issues + 1 bonus feature
   - Link dependencies
   - Add labels and priorities
3. ⏳ Kick off STORY-001 (Project Scaffolding)
4. ⏳ Weekly sync meetings
5. ⏳ Track progress via issue labels and epic updates
