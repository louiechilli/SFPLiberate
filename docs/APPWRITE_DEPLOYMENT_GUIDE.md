## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Appwrite Cloud, verify these items:

### **Local Environment**

- [ ] Code is on branch: `claude/fix-conditional-imports-011CUp139rjmAWXzfiewN7iy`
- [ ] All commits pushed to remote
- [ ] No merge conflicts with main branch
- [ ] Package dependencies up to date (`npm install`)

### **Appwrite Configuration**

- [ ] Appwrite project created (ID: `69078b02001266c5d333`)
- [ ] Project endpoint configured
- [ ] Authentication enabled
- [ ] Test user account created

### **Environment Variables**

For Appwrite deployment, verify these are set in Appwrite Console:

```bash
# Appwrite Sites will auto-inject these:
APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_ENDPOINT=https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1  # Auto-injected
APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID=69078b02001266c5d333              # Auto-injected

# Or set manually:
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=69078b02001266c5d333
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Appwrite Infrastructure

**Deploy Collections and Buckets:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/user/SFPLiberate

# Install Appwrite CLI if needed
npm install -g appwrite-cli

# Login to Appwrite
appwrite login

# Select your project
appwrite client --endpoint https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1 --projectId 69078b02001266c5d333

# Deploy database collections
appwrite deploy collection

# Deploy storage buckets
appwrite deploy bucket
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Deploying collections...
  ✓ user-modules (created)
  ✓ community-modules (created)
✓ Deploying buckets...
  ✓ user-eeprom (created)
  ✓ community-blobs (created)
  ✓ community-photos (created)
```

> ℹ️  Alternatively run `node scripts/appwrite/provision.mjs` from the repository root to reconcile databases, collections, and
> buckets programmatically. The script is idempotent and enforces the canonical IDs listed in `docs/APPWRITE_NATIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Step 2: Verify in Appwrite Console

**Navigate to**: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-69078b02001266c5d333

**Verify Database:**
1. Go to **Databases** → **lib-core**
2. Verify collections:
   - ✅ `user-modules` (Personal library)
     - Attributes: name, vendor, model, serial, sha256, eeprom_file_id, size
     - Indexes: idx_sha256 (unique), idx_created (desc)
     - Settings: Document Security = **ON**
   - ✅ `community-modules` (Community)
     - Already configured

**Verify Storage:**
1. Go to **Storage**
2. Verify buckets:
   - ✅ `user-eeprom`
     - Max Size: 256 KB
     - Extensions: .bin
     - File Security: **ON**
     - Encryption: **ON**
   - ✅ `community-blobs` (Community)
   - ✅ `community-photos` (Community)

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Appwrite Sites

**Option A: Via Git Integration (Recommended)**

1. Go to **Functions** → **Sites** in Appwrite Console
2. Click **Add Site**
3. Connect GitHub repository: `josiah-nelson/SFPLiberate`
4. Select branch: `claude/fix-conditional-imports-011CUp139rjmAWXzfiewN7iy` (or `main` after merge)
5. Build Settings:
   - **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `frontend/out`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
6. Environment Variables (auto-injected by Appwrite Sites):
   - `APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_ENDPOINT`
   - `APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID`
7. Click **Deploy**

**Option B: Manual Deploy**

```bash
# Build frontend for Appwrite (static export)
cd frontend
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=appwrite npm run build

# Deploy to Appwrite Sites
appwrite deploy site
```

### Step 4: Configure Permissions (Critical!)

**Navigate to Appwrite Console:**

1. **Collections** → **user-modules** → **Settings** → **Permissions**
   - Document Security: ✅ Enabled
   - Collection-level permissions: Leave empty
   - Note: Permissions are set per-document via code

2. **Storage** → **user-eeprom** → **Settings** → **Permissions**
   - File Security: ✅ Enabled
   - Bucket-level permissions: Leave empty
   - Note: Permissions are set per-file via code

**Why?** The improved repository sets permissions programmatically:
```typescript
Permission.read(Role.user(userId))
Permission.update(Role.user(userId))
Permission.delete(Role.user(userId))
```

## 🧪 Testing Procedures

### Test 1: User Authentication

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to deployed site
2. Click "Sign Up" (or "Log In" if test user exists)
3. Enter credentials
4. Verify successful login

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ User logged in
- ✅ Profile visible in header
- ✅ Can access protected routes

### Test 2: Module Creation

**Steps:**
1. Connect SFP device via Web Bluetooth
2. Read EEPROM from device
3. Click "Save Module"
4. Enter module name
5. Submit

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Success message displayed

- ✅ Check Appwrite Console:
  - Document created in `user-modules`
  - File created in `user-eeprom`
  - Permissions: `read(user:USER_ID)`, `update(user:USER_ID)`, `delete(user:USER_ID)`

**Verify in Console:**
```javascript
// In browser DevTools
const doc = await databases.getDocument('lib-core', 'user-modules', 'MODULE_ID');
console.log(doc.$permissions);
// Should show: ["read("user:USER_ID")", "update("user:USER_ID")", "delete("user:USER_ID")"]
```

### Test 3: Module List

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/modules` page
2. View list of saved modules

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ All user's modules displayed
- ✅ Vendor, model, serial parsed correctly
- ✅ Created timestamp shown

### Test 4: Duplicate Detection

**Steps:**
1. Save a module (Module A)
2. Read the SAME EEPROM again
3. Try to save with different name

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ System detects duplicate (SHA-256 match)
- ✅ Message: "Module already exists (SHA256 match). Using existing ID xxx"
- ✅ No new document created
- ✅ No new file uploaded

### Test 5: Module Download (Write to Device)

**Steps:**
1. Click "Write" on a saved module
2. Confirm action
3. Observe write process

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ EEPROM data downloaded from storage
- ✅ Data written to SFP device
- ✅ Success message displayed

### Test 6: Module Deletion

**Steps:**
1. Delete a module from list
2. Confirm deletion
3. Check Appwrite Console

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Module removed from list
- ✅ Document deleted from `user-modules`
- ✅ File deleted from `user-eeprom`

### Test 7: Multi-User Isolation

**Steps:**
1. Create module as User A
2. Log out
3. Log in as User B
4. Navigate to `/modules`

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ User B sees ONLY their own modules
- ✅ User A's modules are NOT visible
- ✅ Trying to access User A's file directly → 403 Forbidden

### Test 8: Error Handling

**Test Rate Limiting:**
1. Make 50+ rapid requests
2. Should see 429 error
3. System should retry automatically

**Test Network Failure:**
1. Disconnect network during upload
2. Reconnect
3. System should retry

**Test Auth Expiry:**
1. Let session expire
2. Try to create module
3. Should see "Authentication required" message

## 🔍 Monitoring & Validation

### Console Logs

**Success Indicators:**
```javascript
// Module creation
"Creating module with permissions for user: USER_ID"
"File uploaded successfully: FILE_ID"
"Document created successfully: DOC_ID"

// Duplicate detection
"Duplicate found for SHA256: abc123..."
"Returning existing module: DOC_ID"

// Retry logic
"Retrying after 1000ms (attempt 1/3)"
"Operation succeeded after retry"
```

**Error Indicators:**
```javascript
// Missing permissions (should NOT see this)
"Error 401: Authentication required"  # If seen, permissions not set correctly

// AppwriteException (expected for transient issues)
"AppwriteException: Service unavailable (503)"
"Retrying operation..."
```

### Appwrite Console Metrics

**Navigate to**: Console → Project → Overview

**Monitor:**
- **Requests/min**: Should stay < 1000 (rate limit is higher)
- **Database reads**: Normal range for user activity
- **Storage uploads**: Should match module creations
- **Error rate**: Should be < 1%

**Set up Alerts:**
- Error rate > 5%
- 429 (rate limit) errors
- Storage quota > 80%

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module list is empty" (Most Common)

**Symptoms:**
- User creates module
- Success message shown
- List remains empty

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check browser DevTools console for errors
2. Check Appwrite Console → Databases → user-modules
   - Are documents created?
   - What are the `$permissions` on the document?

**Likely Cause:** Permissions not set (using old repository)

**Fix:**
1. Verify using improved repository:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1 frontend/src/lib/repositories/AppwriteRepository.ts
   # Should show: "fix: replace AppwriteRepository with improved version"
   ```
2. If using old version, re-deploy with improved version
3. Delete test documents and retry

### Issue: "File upload fails"

**Symptoms:**
- Error during module creation
- "Failed to save module" message

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check file size (should be < 256 KB)
2. Check bucket permissions
3. Check storage quota

**Fix:**
- Verify bucket `user-eeprom` exists
- Verify file security is enabled
- Check quota in Appwrite Console

### Issue: "Orphaned files in storage"

**Symptoms:**
- Files in storage with no matching document
- Storage usage higher than expected

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Count documents
# In Appwrite Console: Databases → user-modules → View Documents

# Count files
# In Appwrite Console: Storage → user-eeprom → View Files

# If file count > document count, orphans exist
```

**Fix:**
- Improved repository has cleanup logic
- Old repository did not
- Manually delete orphaned files via Console
