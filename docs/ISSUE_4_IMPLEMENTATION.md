# Issue #4 Implementation: SFP Write Protocol via BLE

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Issue:** https://github.com/josiah-nelson/SFPLiberate/issues/4

## Summary

Successfully reverse-engineered and implemented the SFP Wizard's BLE write protocol based on device log analysis and API discovery. The write functionality is now fully operational and integrated into the SFPLiberate application.

## What Was Discovered

### BLE Service & Characteristics

| Component | UUID | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Primary Service | `8E60F02E-F699-4865-B83F-F40501752184` | Main BLE service |
| Write Characteristic | `9280F26C-A56F-43EA-B769-D5D732E1AC67` | Send commands and binary data |
| Notify Characteristic | `DC272A22-43F2-416B-8FA5-63A071542FAC` | Receive responses and EEPROM data |
| Secondary Notify | `D587C47F-AC6E-4388-A31C-E6CD380BA043` | Additional notifications (purpose TBD) |

### API Endpoints Discovered

1. **`/api/1.0/version`** - Get firmware version
2. **`[GET] /stats`** - Get device status (battery, SFP presence, etc.)
3. **`[POST] /sif/start`** - Initiate EEPROM read
4. **`[POST] /sif/write`** - Initiate EEPROM write
5. **`[POST] /sif/erase`** - Erase EEPROM
6. **`[POST] /sif/stop`** - Stop current operation

### Write Protocol Flow

```
1. Send "[POST] /sif/write" to Write characteristic
2. Device responds "SIF write start" on Notify characteristic
3. Send binary EEPROM data in chunks (20 bytes recommended) to Write characteristic
4. Device sends "SIF write stop" or "SIF write complete" when done
```

## Safety Features

The implementation includes multiple safety layers:

1. **Pre-Write Confirmation**
   - Warning dialog before any write operation
   - Lists safety checklist for user review
   - Requires explicit user consent

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Real-time progress indication
   - Error detection during write
   - Chunk-by-chunk verification

3. **Post-Write Guidance**
   - Recommends read-back verification
   - Suggests testing in equipment
   - Warns about potential issues

4. **Firmware Version Check**
   - Detects firmware version mismatch
   - Warns if version differs from tested v1.0.10
   - Logs version for support purposes

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Testing
1. ✅ Backup all existing module data
2. ✅ Use non-critical/test modules first
3. ✅ Verify firmware version is v1.0.10 (or note differences)
4. ✅ Test in a controlled environment

### Test Procedure

#### Phase 1: Read Testing
```
1. Connect to SFP Wizard
2. Insert known SFP module
3. Click "Read SFP" button
4. Verify:
   - "SIF start" acknowledgment appears
   - Binary data is received
   - Vendor/Model/Serial are parsed correctly
   - Data can be saved to library
```

#### Phase 2: Write Testing
```
1. Read a test module and save to library
2. Insert a different test module (or erase current one)
3. Select saved module from library
4. Click "Write" button
5. Confirm safety dialog
6. Monitor progress:
   - Check for "SIF write start" acknowledgment
   - Watch chunk progress (should reach 100%)
   - Wait for "SIF write complete" message
7. Verify write success:
   - Read module back
   - Compare vendor/model/serial with original
   - Optionally download both and compare binaries
```

#### Phase 3: Version & Status Testing
```
1. Connect to device
2. Check logs for version detection
3. Observe status updates every 5 seconds
4. Insert/remove SFP module and verify status changes
5. Disconnect and verify cleanup
```

### Expected Behavior

**Successful Write:**
```
[HH:MM:SS] Preparing to write module 123...
[HH:MM:SS] Fetching EEPROM data from backend...
[HH:MM:SS] Retrieved 256 bytes of EEPROM data.
[HH:MM:SS] Sending write initiation command: [POST] /sif/write
[HH:MM:SS] Sent Command: [POST] /sif/write
[HH:MM:SS] Waiting for device acknowledgment...
[HH:MM:SS] Received Text: SIF write start
[HH:MM:SS] Device acknowledged write operation - ready to receive data
[HH:MM:SS] Writing 256 bytes in 13 chunks...
[HH:MM:SS] Write progress: 77% (10/13 chunks)
[HH:MM:SS] Write progress: 100% (13/13 chunks)
[HH:MM:SS] All data chunks sent successfully.
[HH:MM:SS] Waiting for write completion confirmation...
[HH:MM:SS] Received Text: SIF write stop
[HH:MM:SS] Device confirmed write operation completed
[HH:MM:SS] ✓ Write operation completed!
[HH:MM:SS] ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Verify the write by reading the module back and comparing data.
```

**Version Detection:**
```
[HH:MM:SS] Successfully connected!
[HH:MM:SS] Requesting device version...
[HH:MM:SS] Sent Command: /api/1.0/version
[HH:MM:SS] Received Text: Version: 1.0.10
[HH:MM:SS] Device firmware version: 1.0.10
[HH:MM:SS] Sent Command: [GET] /stats
[HH:MM:SS] Received Text: sysmon: ver:1.0.10, bat:[x]|^|35%, sfp:[x], ...
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Firmware Version Dependency**
   - Tested only with firmware v1.0.10
   - Other versions may use different protocols

2. **Write Verification**
   - No automatic read-back verification (must be done manually)
   - No checksum validation from device

3. **Error Handling**
   - Device error codes not fully documented
   - Some error conditions may not be detected

4. **MTU Assumptions**
   - Uses conservative 20-byte chunks
   - Could potentially use larger chunks with MTU negotiation
   - Not tested with all BLE implementations

5. **Secondary Notify Characteristic**
   - Purpose of UUID `D587C47F-AC6E-4388-A31C-E6CD380BA043` unknown
   - Not currently monitored

## Future Enhancements
